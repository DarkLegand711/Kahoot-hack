# Kahoot-hack
This is a Kahoot cheat made for Chrome browser and Tampermonkey. Made in vanilla js but tested only on Chromium browsers.

Instructions
Open the KaHack!.user.js

Click raw to install this script to Tampermonkey or copy-paste it on the console. Ctrl+Shift+i opens the developer tab and there you can find the console. Paste the code the code there and press enter to run it.

Type in the quiz ID. You should see it on the host's screen. If the quiz ID box is still red after typing in the right quiz ID that means the Kahoot is private and this cannot be used with it. image

Have happy cheating :). Also here is another tip don't put the points slider over 987 it will cause the points to be 1000 automatically because that's how Kahoot calculates the points. Try to make the points as non-suspicious as possible.

Features
The latest version includes Auto Answer, Show Answers, and Answer Speed. Only quiz and multi-select answers are supported. Type answers and everything else are not supported yet. By pressing Alt+h on your keyboard it will hide the menu and by pressing Alt+x it will terminate the menu. You can drag the menu from the top bar and minimize and close if you want. Closing the cheat will end the script and will not auto-answer or show the answers. You can use this as a panic button. Or just do Alt+x.
